# APIM Management + DevOps Demo Project

This repo consists of...

* A .net 6 WebAPI, based on the [TODO sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/dotnet-core-api).  The API exposes a swagger definition and is designed to be run on Azure App Service.
* Bicep scripts to deploy an App Service, a Storage Account and an API Management Instance.
